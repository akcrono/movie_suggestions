movie_suggestions
=================

Movie app that takes in an individual movie and calculates what other movies the view is likely to enjoy based on other users.

Current logic is to get the 100 users who rated the current movie the highest, and aggregate their 10 highest movie choices.

This could be combined with a login and watched history to remove possible movies and make the data more useful.
